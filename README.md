## Basics of electronics: Ohm's Law
Before getting to the motors, sensors, and power, it is necessary to understand some basics.  
Please read through the pages from Sparkfun's [basics of electricity and ohms law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/electricity-basics)

## Circuit Playground Express (CPE)
1. Learn a little about [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/guided-tour)   
2. Creating the programming file the CPE can be done using the [makecode page for adafruit](https://makecode.adafruit.com/)
3. [Compile and download your code](https://learn.adafruit.com/makecode/downloading-and-flashing) to the CPE

## Arduino
### Download and Install Arduino IDE
The following is a link where you can dowload the Arduino IDE (integrated design environment).  As of 08/21/23, the latest version is 2.1.1.  Download the version appropriate for your

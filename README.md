## Basics:

#### A. Read through the following web page and answer the following questions.
Go to: [Sparkfun Description of Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/electricity-basics)
1. What is Electricity? 


2. What is the formula for Ohm’s Law?


3. What do V, I and R represent in Ohm’s formula? What are their units?


4. If you have a voltage supply of 5V and across a resistor of 50 ohms, what will the current be?


## Breadboards
We will be using “breadboards” for the majority of our projects. 
Go to the [Science Buddies site on how to use a breadboard](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/how-to-use-a-breadboard).  After reviewing the webpage and/or watching the video, answer the following:

#### B. Find the picture of the lettered and numbered breadboard. Answer the following:
1. Is A5 connected to D5?

2. Is C12 connected to D12?

3. Is 2E connected to 2F?

4. Is 15D connected to 14D?

#### C. What are the strips along the side called? What are they generally used for? 


## Number 3: Safety
1. Always turn off power or disconnect power from the circuit when adding, changing, or moving components on the breadboard or microcontroller board.
2. We generally work with fairly low power devices.  We do have some higher power batteries, but those are for later when you have a better grip on electronics.
3. All components have a maximum current and voltage that they can handle.  Exceeding these limits will damage the component. This is what Ohm's law is for.  Use resistors to limit current where appropriate. 

## First Circuit:
#### D.   Go to [Sparkfun page on LEDs](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-emitting-diodes-leds) and use a breadboard to build the circuit shown in the "LEDs Without Math" section.

2. Creating the programming file the CPE can be done using the [makecode page for adafruit](https://makecode.adafruit.com/)
3. [Compile and download your code](https://learn.adafruit.com/makecode/downloading-and-flashing) to the CPE

## Arduino
### Download and Install Arduino IDE
The following is a link where you can dowload the Arduino IDE (integrated design environment).  As of 03/24/2024, the latest version is 2.3.2.  Download the version appropriate for your 
operating system (OS).  This will most likely be the windows 10 or newer version. 

1. Download IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  **(REMEMBER THE DIRECTORY YOU DOWNLOAD TO)**
   * Do not use windows installer.
2. Follow these instructions: [Downloading and Installing Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing)
